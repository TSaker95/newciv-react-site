            3D Printing is one of my favourite and more expensive Hobby's, and I
            love to make my own Creations. Here I display photos of some of the
            designs I have made, the 3D Printed Results (If available) and how
            they fit into the Universe of my story.

              County Town Design: <br /> <br />
              This city design depicts a small urban center, with a population
              of around 1000. Connected by rail to other towns, this is one of a
              1000 county towns per Region.

              Armored Personal Carrier: <br /> <br />
              This design was based of an old 3D printed model that I have
              worked on over and over as I improved in my ability to create such
              models. It depicts an Armored Personal Carrier that was designed
              to ferry Knights across Urban centers and flat terrain. Rarely
              seen by the public outside of War Game Scenarios.

              An Artillary/ Anti Tank gun, Like many Nation weapons are able to
              fire both direct laser beams and explosive shells. This design was
              one of the first I printed on my first printer to test its
              ability, to quite a surprising level of success.

              National Assault Jet: <br /> <br />
              The N.A.T is designed and depoloyed in acordence to War Plan Red.
              A doctrine that focus's on Attack and Mobility. The N.A.T Fits
              comfortably into the Offensive wing of The Nations Standard
              Military. Able to rapidly deliver strikes and recon ahead of an
              Attack. They are incredibly light and for what they lack in armor,
              make up in speed. One of the easier designs to make and print,
              plus was quite fun making something that needed to look like it
              was built for speed and rapid strikes.

              Hewwit Class Bomber: <br /> <br />
              One of the larger planes designed for use against Civilian targets
              and opponents whom lack technology or sufficent anti air
              weaponary. The H.C.B Acts as a gun platform, laying down
              highpowered shots to eliminate individual targets with pinpoint
              accuracy. Generally once it chooses a target or area to cover, it
              will fly around in an Arc exposing its underside to its target
              where its three main guns can fire upon their victims. This
              aircraft was a massive print and is one of my least favourites due
              to its design and scale making it quite inconvient to store.

              The NDB Gunship <br /> <br />A Medium level gunship, designed to
              simply fill the role of an attack helicoper. This Aircraft was a
              long time favourite of mine, for while not being my best creation.
              It was the first that started to capture what I imagined the
              aircraft to look like, and showed I was starting to be able to
              bring to life my ideas. Plus the level of detail I got was quite
              satisfying.

              The City Killer: <br /> <br />A Design I have not finished making,
              The idea behind it is simply. A massive walker on six limbs with a
              big gun, designed to eliminate city's in a single blast.
              Highlighting a willingness to use it upon its own people given its
              simple existance in a world with no opposing Nations.

              Medium Battle Tank: <br /> <br />
              Heavily armored and powerful, this Tank like many Nation machines
              is supported by anti grave tech to reduce its weight impact and
              operate as if it was a far lighter vehicle. Able to shoot both
              shells and laser blasts, popular in Regional Wargames. <br />{" "}
              <br /> One of my best designs, and quite fun to make. The Wheels
              on the side are held in by assembleable side pannels that click
              into place and very little glue was required to put this print
              together. The Print came out quite well and was fun to paint.
              Though its tank barrel warped in the heat of my car. <br /> <br />
